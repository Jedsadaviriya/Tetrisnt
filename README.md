# Tetrisnt
## Project game, tetris clone coded in C#
This Project is based on the Tetris Nes version.

## Goal

Each Student in our Class got the challenge / Task of programing their own game in C# without the use of a Game Engine.
I chose to use WinForms and Visual Studio for my Project as I thought it would be practical to use for this Project and good to learn. The Goal of this Project is to learn the practical aspect to programing a game, to experiment and expand our knowledge on it.

## Why Tetris

I chose to make a Game like Tetris as I always liked playing it myself and I wanted to understand better how it works so I thought: "why not just make it myself?"

Tetris is a very recognised game and beloved by Generations, alot of people grew up with Tetris.
